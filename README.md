                                   #  Y Media Labs Challenge
                                    
## Implementation:
__________________________________________
###  UI Design:<br /> 
#### 1. INTRO SCREEN: <br />
  * User is presented with a screen to enter the Username and click on a button to transition to the next screen. <br />
  * a rudimentary design implemented as per the design challenge guidelines
  * Worked on a 8inch tablet during development 
  * spaced out the three views to far parts of the screen as a design choice.<br />

#### 2. FOLLOWERS DISPLAY:<br />
  * once again guided by the challenge hints and used third party libraries to achieve the desired effect (grid with 3 columns). <br />

#### 3. FOLLOWER DETAIL PAGE:<br />
  * Followed the challenge guidlines but took degin liberty with the implementation 
  * Implemented CollapsableLayout that scrolls up
     * expanded shows the avatar and other information about the user
     * collapsed shows only the User name 
     * back arrow action implemented which also shows some preliminary transition 

### Coding Architecture:<br />
     1. Adopted a MVVM type of architecture ,with the code base divided into folders indicating the diffrent components
